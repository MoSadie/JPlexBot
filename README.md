# JPlexbot

## What is this?

It's a Discord bot designed to play music from a [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv). (And a few other sources as well)

## How to use

1) Create a discord bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), taking note of the bot token.
1) Select the computer/server you want to use. (I would recommend on the same computer as the Plex Media Server)
2) Download the latest release from [here](/MoSadie/JPlexBot/releases/latest) on to that computer and extract the contents. (And make sure Java is installed!)
3) Run the JPlexBot.bat file in the bin folder and follow the on-screen instructions.
4) Go to the web address in the console window after finishing setup to invite the bot to your server.
5) Start playing songs with the play command! (You can either DM commands to the bot or use the prefix in any text channel)

## Useful Commands
- `help`: Displays all available commands.
- `play <song name or url>`: Plays a song.
- `skip`: Skips the current song.
- `queue`: Shows the current queue of songs.
